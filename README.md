## Challenge

Create a website with 3 recipes. The recipes are listed at the [bottom.](###Recipes)

Create 3 files:

- index.html : Your HTML file
- script.js : Your Javascript file
- style.css : Your CSS file

Creativity is up to you, but I have put a screenshot of what I created so you can
get a little inspiration but make yours in your own style!

When the user moves the slider for that recipe, the amount of ingredients
dynamically changes, it’s as simple as that.
